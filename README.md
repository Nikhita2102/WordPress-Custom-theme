# WordPress-Custom-theme
Description-
Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I am proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we are dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.

System Requirements -

PHP version 7.2.24 or greater.

MySQL version 5.5.5 or greater.


Installation: Famous 5-minute install-

1.Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.
Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a wp-config.php file with your database connection details.
2.If for some reason this does not work, do not worry. It may not work on all web hosts. Open up wp-config-sample.php with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.
3.Save the file as wp-config.php and upload it.
4.Open wp-admin/install.php in your browser.
5.Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your site. If there is an error, double check your wp-config.php file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the WordPress support forums with as much data as you can gather.
6.If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you. If you did not provide a username, it will be admin.
7.The installer should then send you to the login page. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on “Profile” to change the password.

Final Notes-
If you have any suggestions, ideas, or comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the Support Forums.
WordPress has a robust plugin API (Application Programming Interface) that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the Plugin Developer Handbook. You shouldn’t modify any of the core code.
